# React Bootstrap Todo App
Todo App with React and Bootstrap
Demo the app on https://wraithwinterly.github.io/react-bootstrap-todo/

Todo App built with React, Vite, and Bootstrap. Built in 1 day.
You can add basic tasks, remove them, compelte them and remove completed tasks.
This app does not have a backend and is for demonstration purposes only. It is using local browser storage.

Note on commits: this app was going to be converted, however I have decided to make it its own app.
